JavaScript objects are like labeled boxes: each box (object) has labels (keys) that point to different things (values). For example, { name: "Sara", age: 17 } is like a box labeled 'name' with 'Sara' inside and 'age' with '17' inside.

You can peek inside these boxes using dots or brackets â€“ person.name or person["name"].

Boxes are flexible; you can add, change, or remove stuff anytime, like updating a list of favorite snacks.

Objects can also share features from other objects, like getting cool superpowers from a superhero team.

To share your boxes with others, you can turn them into readable messages using JSON.stringify().

JavaScript takes care of cleaning up unused boxes, like tidying up your room to avoid clutter.

And boxes have unique ways of introducing themselves (toString) and showing their real worth (valueOf).
