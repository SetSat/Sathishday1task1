HTTP/1.1: The Old Way

HTTP/1.1 is the older version of the web protocol.
It fetches web page elements one at a time, leading to slower page loading.
Every request and response carries redundant header data, which wastes bandwidth.
Slow-loading resources can block others from loading, causing delays.
HTTP/2: The New Way

HTTP/2 is the improved, faster version.
It loads multiple resources simultaneously, reducing page load times.
Header compression minimizes data overhead, making it faster on slower connections.
Server push sends resources to the browser before it asks, further boosting speed.
Prioritization ensures critical resources load first, improving user experience.
HTTP/2 uses a more efficient binary protocol, simplifying data exchange.
In simple terms, HTTP/2 is like a speedier, smarter courier for the web, delivering your web content faster and more efficiently than the older HTTP/1.1.
